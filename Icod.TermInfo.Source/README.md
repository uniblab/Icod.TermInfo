# Icod.TermInfo.Source

`Icod.TermInfo.Source` is the optional terminfo source-language layer for
`Icod.TermInfo`.

The package is intentionally separate from the stable runtime package. Ordinary
applications that only load or use `TerminalDescription` values continue to
reference `Icod.TermInfo` alone.

## 1.1.0 development line

The 1.1 line will add managed parsing and resolution of `.ti` source, including
source diagnostics, cancellation, extended capabilities, and `use=`
inheritance. Resolved source entries materialize into the same immutable
`TerminalDescription` model used by compiled terminfo acquisition.

`1.1.0-Alpha-1` is the S01 package foundation. It establishes the package,
dependency, build, test, packaging, API-equivalence, and fresh-consumer
contracts. The first source-language API is introduced by S02.

The runtime dependency direction is one-way:

```text
Icod.TermInfo.Source
        |
        v
  Icod.TermInfo
```

`Icod.TermInfo` does not depend on this package.
